* Heterogeneity
How does heterogeneity affect the range of frequencies that the
network can operate at? We could fix the (average) number of dendrites
and see what happens to the information transmission-sparsification
tradeoff *parametrised by the MF firing rate* as we vary the
heterogeneity of the model. In other words, we can take figure S5C in
the paper, discard all points for d!=4, "connect the dots" for d=4
across different MF rates (perhaps increasing the number of data
points), and see how the resulting plot varies as we vary
heterogeneity.
** Network connectivity
Change the network connectivity statistics to compare the d=4 case
with a more realistic distribution over d within the network.
** Granule cell physiology
Introduce heterogeneity in single cell properties. We can do this by
using my population model built on top of Dan's data.
** Synaptic properties
Incorporate the synaptic amplitude distribution from Sargent 2005.
