* Is it possible to use my simulations to support the main claim made in Guy's paper?
** Meeting with Angus and Guy <2013-11-19 Tue>
*** Points for discussion
1. what cell model? should I use my new cell model population? in this
   case, what about the single-cell-level disorder? given that's
   impossible to treat this by annealing (ie averaging over it), at
   which point should I quench it (ie fix network configuration)? An
   alternative is to use the average model from my population.
2. I also need to remember to update the value of the GABA reversal
   potential with the figure from Seja2012.
3. Speaking of quenched disorder, what did Guy do for the
   connection-driven disorder?
4. I guess we're going to use my new model for the mf->grc
   synapse.. this means using jLEMS (ie suicide) unless we get the
   network simulation export function to run. Or do I? probably not,
   if the network is still described with neuroConstruct.
5. What exactly do we mean with "testing with rate code"? if it's only
   rate in-rate out, we don't need to use Conor's metric (or more
   precisely, we don't need a Van Rossum-type metric), as we can just
   use spike counts.
6. How to measure sparsity in the rate-coded case? An interesting idea
   would be to use the Gini index, but this is a measure of inequality
   and would give sparsity=1 in the case of a silent network. If by
   sparsity we really mean "global activation level", I can just use
   the average firing rate of the network, but in that case I would
   still have to normalize it somehow to compare it to the firing rate
   of the inputs (to impose the sparsifying condition p(GC)<p(MF)).
7. I guess the best thing to do would be to check if my simulations
   agree with Guy's prediction in a low entropy limit, or in general
   to compare for eg the 4000-pattern case (might help to consider
   short time windows and spike counting metric). Otherwise, it's
   going to be impossible to do all of the required simulations.
8. One thing I still need to do is to implement Guy's connectivity
   rules (or maybe not, in case we want to compare the numerical
   results with the random bipartite graph).
9. what about doing a frequency-response curve of the grc model to
   test the 30ms integration window hypothesis? As an RC circuit, my
   average grc model has a time constant of about 6ms (so no problem
   on that front), and the longest decay time constant in my synaptic
   models is 121ms for the second component of the NMDAr-mediated
   synapse. But this component is less than 1/6th in amplitude than
   the first component, which has a time constant of 13.5ms, so
   overall I might get lucky and get away with considering a 50ms
   integration window.
10. for the time windowing side of things, it might be possible to just
    do the same simulations with synchronised and desynchronised Golgi
    input, and see what effect that has on the rate-coded information
    flow. We don’t expect it to have /any/ effect, but that should help
    address the reviewer’s concerns.
11. It might even be possible, even though probably outside the scope
    of the work, make an /analytical/ rate-code extension to the
    existing work. Moreno-Bote et al (2006) estimate the firing rate
    and the Fano factor for the spike count in the case of a leaky
    integrate-and-fire neuron with Poisson input and synaptic time
    constants longer than the membrane time constant. This could in
    theory enable us to calculate mean and variance for the spike count
    of a neuron with any given input, and so, by hypothesising a
    Gaussian distribution in spike count, the full conditional
    probability distribution of the spike counts for all the cells in a
    network given the input rates and the connectivity matrix. from
    here one should be able to calculate the MI, as this would look
    like some sort of multidimensional Gaussian channel. This is
    analogous to what Guy did for the explicit calculation of entropy
    in the "small" case with 4000 patterns. Anyway, this approach would
    break down near the refractory limit.
12. How are we going to deal with the effect of STP in my GoC->GrC
    synaptic model? One could hardcode a dependency of the Golgi
    firing rate on the p(MF) parameter, but because of depression, the
    time-averaged amount of inhibitory conductance doesn't scale
    linearly with the Golgi firing rate. Initially we will just use
    a varying tonic inhibition as a thresholding mechanism, and once
    we are suer we can get that working we will move on to using
    inhibitory synaptic input. Note that the levels of tonic
    conductance will be tuned depending on their thresholding effect,
    and not on their biological realism. This will probably mean
    choosing unrealistically high levels of inhibition.
*** Outcomes of the meeting
We are aiming for a set of punctual comparisons (not parameter sweeps)
between different network configurations. Initially, we are aiming to
show that we can reproduce some of the main results in the study with
a spiking network model with detailed synaptic connectivity. In other
words, for example, "show that the network with 4 dendrites is
significantly better than the network with 10 dendrites under
appropriate conditions". Because of the high computational costs
involved, this is more akin to what one would do experimentally than
to a numerical extension of the analytical results.
- network size: 500 GrCs
- use fixed tonic inhibition, set to an appropriate level (possibly
  the "natural" level of ~400pS).
- use Jason's average GrC model
- use my mf->GrC model built from Jason's data
- 1000 patterns
- 50 repetitions per pattern
- simulation time as short as possible compatibly with the duration of
  the integration window (hypothesised to be ~30ms in the paper,
  probably somewhere between that and 120ms, which is the longest time
  constant present in the synaptic mechanisms)
- number of dendrites d=4 and d=10
- use spatially correlated patterns. This should help in making the
  system more susceptible to variations in its parameters by making it
  harder to discriminate the patterns. Actually one could do both:
  correlated and uncorrelated patterns, and show the difference.
- use a pure rate code (rate in, rate out).
If there is time, we could add the following features:
- modulate sinusoidally input rate in time
- use the MUVR metric to cluster output

This is with respect to my old runs back in spring 2012, which if I
remember correctly took about a week on matlem with 180 processors
(even though I might be overestimating this time if the batches of
jobs I was running were larger. Anyway, the values listed here were
for a simulation run size that I considered "typical", small enough to
be rerun if something went wrong).

This of course assumes everything scales linearly and doesn't account
for overheads associated to running a larger number of smaller
simulations and having more complex synaptic models, but it is
encouraging, at least from the point of view of running the
simulations.

	The pipeline seems to work, but we'd be better off using a pure rate
	code for better performance.
***** Conclusion
My quick estimate above seems to hold for the simulation, but I think
that for the analysis we need to use a simpler decoder.
** Model-related and scientific choices that need to be made
*** TODO frequency response of the GrC model to synaptic stimulation
    I have to check if the 30ms integration time window hypothesis is
    justified, and adjust the length of the simulations accordingly.
    It looks like a good way of justifying this would be by looking at
    the autocorrelation function of the spike train produced by the
    cell model under Poisson stimulation at different rates. This
    actually shows that, for stimulation rates high enough to give a
    decent estimate of the ACF with a simulation 60s long, the
    autocorrelation seems to drop to its asymptotic value (the average
    firing rate) after about 50ms (see figures below, and note that
    the reported stimulation rate is for each of 4 MFs).
    
    Another interesing phenomenon can be seen in this experiment: as
    reported in Moreno-Bote and Parga 2006, there are two regimes
    depending on whether the average membrane depolarization is above
    or below threshold. Below threshold firing is driven by
    fluctuations and input spike bunching, while above threshold
    the cell tend to fire regularly and fluctuations only add noise to
    this process. This is reflected in a different structure of the
    ACF in the two cases.

    [[file:fig/acf_160Hz_detail.png]]

**** TODO Have a look at how Guy explains the 30ms assumption in the paper.
**** DONE Look at lower stimulation frequencies and longer simulations, to make sure these observations do not depend on the rates chosen.
     CLOSED: [2013-11-28 Thu 18:45]
     - CLOSING NOTE [2013-11-28 Thu 18:45] \\
       It's fine. Even with rates close to the cell threshold the
       autocorrelation falls to the 'uncorrelated baseline' in less than
       about 40ms.
*** output decoder: pure rate code vs spike metric
    The tradeoff between performance and added usefulness seems in
    favour of using a pure rate code, at least in the first stage as
    we use a rate-coded input.
*** DONE inhibition: decide on the (fixed) level of tonic GABA conductance
    CLOSED: [2013-11-27 Wed 12:26]
    - CLOSING NOTE [2013-11-27 Wed 12:26] \\
      The experimental value of 0.438nS seems the best option.
*** DONE mf -> grc synapses: decide if total conductance should scale inversely with the number of dendrites.
    CLOSED: [2013-11-28 Thu 18:44]
    - CLOSING NOTE [2013-11-28 Thu 18:44] \\
      No, it shouldn't change, otherwise altering the number of dendrites in
      the spiking model would have a very different meaning than in th
      binary model.
*** DONE Make a table of all the parameters in the model, noting where each of them comes from.

When doing this, we should keep in mind the ~40um figure for

       Figure [[fig:rate_IO]] shows that my model tends to fire a bit more
       than Jason's. This was expected, and (given that the cell
       models are very similar in the two cases) mostly depends on the
       time-averaged NMDA component of my synaptic model being
       somewhat larger. This, in turn, depends on the fact that both
       me and Jason normalised the NMDA waveform at -60mV to have the
       same peak amplitude as the AMPA component, with the two NMDA
       models having a different base waveform shape. Specifically, my
       waveform is somewhat less peaked than Jason's, so this results
       in a larger time-averaged conductance in my mode. Anyway, as
       can be seen in the figure below, the value for the
       time-averaged NMDA to AMPA ratio remains within the biological
       range as published in Schwartz2012.

     Unless you have already solved it I would suggest an
     implementation such as the following

     i) generate glomerular degree distribution (that of a binomial)

     ii) for each (randomly chosen) connection chose a granule cell to
     connect to subject to the constraints:

     connection length as close as possible to 'x' (we used 15 microns I believe)
     granule cell would not have more than 'd' connections
     the connection does not repeat with a granule cell to which the glom. is already connectioned
     the connection would not cause a single mossy fibre to be connection to the same granule cell
     [The last one is a bit of an artificial one that had to be introduced because for high number of connections, the resampling because an problem since it diminishes the number
     of independent inputs to the network, which create conceptual issues]
       
     The above also assumes that all cells and connections are
     confined to the same sphere (connections do not penetrate the
     sphere holding the GRCs).

     The problem I am having is that I also definately had to create a
     method to shuffle some connections about with the aim of
     minimising the mean squared deviation from the target dendrite
     lenght. I think it might be that the above created a weird
     dendrite length distribution (i.e. not central). But I am not
     sure and I cant look at my Mathematica notebooks right now.

     So try the above. You might find it works in which case no
     problem. If there are any problems however, let me know because I
     will probably remember it at that stage!

       Done. This required changing his Mathematica library to add a function
       to compute an adjacency matrix for the network composed by glomeruli
       and granules (as opposed to the network composed by mossy fibres and
       granules), and updating the network generation notebook accordingly.
     It seems like glomerular positions are expressed as a list of
     lists of 3d points, but the length of the lists of points is not
     constant. Also, the graphml file seems to contain a glomerular
     node for each list, and not for each point. What are the extra 3d
     points for? what's the correspondence between nodes in the graph
     and spatial coordinates? Maybe this has something to do with
     having the glomeruli grouped by the MFs to which they belong, and
     then keeping only one glomerulus per MF at some point downstream
     in the code during network building.

** Meeting with Angus and Guy, pre-christmas break <2013-12-13 Fri> 
*** Points for discussion
1. *integration time window*: 
   - I should probably implement it as a free parameter that only
     requests for simulations to be rerun if the new length is longer
     than what's available
   - Are we still going to parameter-sweep in this dimension? it's
     probably worth at least some exploratory analyses, especially
     because after the data management part is implemented it's a
     relatively cheap thing to do (doesn't require additional
     simulations)
2. *inhibition*:
   - implement as a free parameter (using ~bias~?)
   - Are we still going to do the analysis where we see what happens
     to MI in the many-dendrites case if we try to bring
     sparsification levels down to what the few-dendrites network do?
     I think this is a good idea, and since I don't expect
     sparsification to depend on the number patterns we can use
     simulations with few patterns to map sparsification, and then use
     this mappings to select the parameter space points where we want
     to calculate MI for the larger network.
3. Actually, this is in general a good idea: we can calculate
   sparsification for a much wider range of parameters than MI, so we
   should make use of this.
4. *spatial structure*: discrete parameter to switch between random and
   spatial graph I already have randomised replicas of each network
   realisation, so it's just a matter of selecting a different graphml
   file.
5. *input correlation*:
   - how I am going to map the idea of P(MF) to the continuous case
     with gaussian blobs of activation in space? I could do this by
     manipulating the variance, but I have to keep in mind that a
     single gaussian spatial profile will give different average input
     rates depending on where it's centered with respect to the
     border of the tissue sphere. An alternative for working around
     this issue would be to normalise the rate profiles over the set
     of nodes, so that we are sure we always get the same input
     rate. But then again this would effectively alter the sparsity of
     the input pattern.. we need to think if there's a way of 
   - once I've implemented it, apart from the parameters I have
     already to specify mean and fluctuations for rates, I will also
     need a discrete parameter to switch between correlated and
     uncorrelated input.
   - I need to be careful though when confronting network activity for
     correlated and uncorrelated input, as - I guess - I want to make
     sure that the average input rate is the same. so, for example,
     gaussian blobs with peak at 50Hz superimposed over a noisy
     backgorund of 10Hz shouldn't be translated directly to binary
     patterns with 10/50Hz activation; alternativly, the
     transformation should happen very carefully with respect to the
     resulting P(MF).
6. intra-pattern vs inter-pattern correlations
7. should we tune the input correlations to the spatial correlation
   scale in the grcs? This should boost information transmission, but
   we don't know how uniformly across parameter space.
8. in the paper, what will we test with the biologically constrained
   network? We need a clear hypothesis, so that we can test it and
   argue about how highly constrained is the spiking network and why
   it's a good testbed for our hypothesis.
9. should we use some more graph theory to expand on the differences
   between random and anatomical models? See figures
   [[fig:tissue_model_projected]] and [[fig:random_bipartite_projected]].
10. input frequency range? shall we go from 10/50Hz to 10/100Hz? This
    would probably shift the activity for high ~d~ well into
    saturation, thus helping us to make our point.
*** Outcomes of the meeting
**** TODO integration time window
See above. Big simulations with a thousand of patterns should be run
for a longer time, so that in case we have room for investigating the
effect of shortening the time window. It needs to be
promoted to being a parameter anyway.
**** TODO Implement a discrete parameter to switch between random and anatomical graphs.
**** TODO Implement a discrete parameter to switch between correlated and uncorrelated inputs.
**** TODO I have to improve my plots, and in particular make some output sparsity vs input sparsity plots, which would make it easier to visualise ranges over which the network sparsifies.
**** TODO If I've got time to do it, I would like to make some more quantitative analysis on the difference in structure between the random and spatial graphs.
**** TODO Quantitative, numerical measure of sparsification
At the moment, I am using /amplification/ (P(GC)/P(MF)) and Guy is
using /sparsification/ (1-P(GC)/P(MF)). I like /amplification/ because
it's not a negative (ie saying 'network A has lower sparsification
than network B' sounds more ambiguous than saying 'lower
amplification'), but then again 'amplification' has other ambiguities,
as in the spiking network it could be taken to represent some measure
of /gain/ in rates between the inputs and the outputs. In conclusion,
I think either measure would work if we find an appropriate name for
it, and I don't think we need a different mathematical
characterisation of this quantity.
**** Sparsification as an average property of the network transfer function
It's a good idea to make use of the fact that sparsification is an
average property of the network transfer function (maybe make a test
for this?). This implies that we can map out sparsification for a wide
range of points in parameter space, by simulating just a small number
of patterns (we don't even require repetitions, in theory), using this
information to guide our intuition as to where to calculate MI.
**** Input correlations
First of all, our main figure is still going to be about uncorrelated
patterns, as this is the case which is most exhaustingly investigated
in the rest of the paper. Unless we find something extremely
interesting, correlated inputs are going to end up in the
supplementary information anyway.

An example of a particularly interesting thing that might happen is if
we got a sudden boost to information transmission in the anatomical
model when the spatial scale of the input correlations matches the
typical scale of network connectivity.

There are several issues with using gaussian blobs, mainly linked to
the fact that they are unlike our uncorrelated binary patterns /in too
many ways/. One way of introducing spatial correlations without
unnecessarily complicating things is to use *binary tilings* of the
set of glomeruli. Something like an n-nearest-neighbor tiling, which
(as opposed to eg a Voronoi tiling) would allow for exact control over
P(MF).
**** Input rates
We should raise the upper bound of our range of input rates, as this
will make the effect we're looking for more evident, but of course
while staying within what's known from the biology.
**** Role of inhibition
We think that we will be testing the effect of varying level of
inhibition in two situations:
- what would happen if there was a homeostatic mechanism which scaled
  tonic inhibition to match the increase in average excitatory
  conductance we get when increasing the number of dendrites?
- what happens to information transmission if we increase inhibition
  to force networks with many dendrites to sparsify as well as
  networks with fewer dendrites? (sort of like what Guy did in his new
  examples for figure 5)
**** Type of analysis we're going for
If I can, I should try and estimate the efficient frontier by
calculating the sparse encodable range for a sufficiently large number
of network configurations. If this proves to be too computationally
expensive, I should try and make some 'point' measurements of
performance in parameter space, as one would do in the case of an
actual experimental test, trying to analyse a few significant
points. Another idea to keep in mind is to try and be smart about how
I try to determine the sparse encodable range, perhaps by integrating
some sort of nonlinear optimisation technique (but we might be too
short with time for designing that), or some simpler system for not
wasting time exploring the big information plateau in the interior of
the encodable range for a given network configuration.
**** Figure 7 in the paper:
The point we're trying to make is that this is a very stringent test
of our hypothesis, as we're building the spiking network from the
bottom up with respect to the available experimental data on cell and
synaptic physiology and tissue anatomy.

To do this we need:

* Questions to be addressed with the model after we're sure it works
** Is the network with d=4 any better than the one with d=10 at information transmission or sparsification?
   My guess is that, unless our choice of input correlations make a
   massive difference, the d=10 network will be just as good as the
   d=4 network at transmitting information, mainly because we are
   operating with such a small number of patterns and so far away from
   channel capacity. What /could/ be different, though, is the
   sparsification: in that case, if the d=10 network sparsifies less,
   we can then ask: /what is the required amount of tonic inhibition
   to bring sparsification back to where it was with d=4? and what
   happens to information transmission if we set inhibition to that
   value?/ This would also offer a good way of formulating an
   experimentally testable hypothesis: if information transmission is
   still good even in this heavily inhibited case, then this is the
   homeostatic compensation we expect to arise in a mutant mouse with
   large d; otherwise, we expect to see some other mechanism coming
   into play, but still something that would tend towards allowing
   complete information transmission with a sparse code (for example,
   conformational changes in the granule cell's ion channels or a
   decrease in the amount of neurotransmitter released at the mossy
   fibre synapse). Or the mutant mouse's cerebellum might not function
   as well as the wild type's, of course.
*** Pushing the network to its limits <2013-12-04 Wed>
    We assume that the purpose of the network is to strike a balance
    between information transmission and sparsification. Some of the
    parameters in the simulations are relatively free (like input
    correlations and integration time window), and some can be changed
    but we have an idea of what they should be in a 'normal' network
    (like the amount of tonic inhibition). We want to compare, say,
    the network with 4 dendrites to the network with 20 dendrites.
**** Free parameters (input correlation, length of integration time window)
     We start by estimating, in parameter space, the edge of the
     region where the network with 4 dendrites transmits all of the
     information. In practice, this means finding the maximum amount
     of correlations in the inputs or the shortest integration window
     we can use before we start losing information. We then see how
     the network with 20 dendrites performs in these "extreme"
     conditions: our guess is that it will transmit less information
     for strongly correlated inputs and it will sparsify
     (proportionately) less for short integration time windows. My
     idea, though, by looking at the f-f curve in figure [[fig:rate_IO]]
     and considering that our input rates won't go above 50Hz, is that
     _at about 100ms we are already fairly close to the lower limit
     for the integration window in the network with 4 dendrites_, as
     already with 4 30Hz inputs we are below the 10Hz firing threshold
     for detection of a single spike in such a time interval.
**** Tonic inhibition
     Tonic inhibition is not really a free parameter of our model, and
     also has a very direct and obvious effect on sparsification. My
     proposal is that we treat it as an example of a possible
     homeostatic mechanism that could be used by the organism to
     balance the extra excitation the GCL would get if the number of
     dendrites was larger. We can then proceed as follows: we look at
     the network in 'normal' conditions and we note the MI and the
     sparsification, then we increase the number of dendrites from 4
     to 20 and we estimate again these two measures. Presumably, MI
     would be the same (if it's not, all the better) but there will be
     less sparsification. We could then increase inhibition to a level
     that will bring sparsification back to what we had with 4
     dendrites, and observe if there is any decrease in transmitted
     information. If that's the case, we can conclude that it's not
     possible to achieve the same optimal tradeoff between information
     and sparsity in a network with many dendrites without resorting
     to some more complicated homeostatic mechanism.

*** 1/r benchmark as mentioned in the discussion?

*** TODO Once I have a sparsity measure, make some exploratory simulations (even with the random graph model for the network) to have a rough idea of the behaviour of the MI and the sparsity for the cases with, say, 4 and 20 dendrites.
    <2013-12-03 Tue> Preliminary simulations indicate that, at least
    for the random bipartite graph and uncorrelated inputs, and for an
    initial fraction of active mossy fibers of 0.5, the results on
    sparsification are what we expect:
    | dendrites | in sp (activity) | out sp (activity) | in sp (hoyer) | out sp (hoyer) |
    |-----------+------------------+-------------------+---------------+----------------|
    |         3 |              0.5 |              0.85 |          0.27 |           0.61 |
    |         9 |              0.5 |              0.14 |          0.26 |           0.09 |
    We can also note that, at least in this case, the /activity
    sparseness/ measure seems to reflect better our intuition (I
    wonder if the Treves-Rolls measure would perform better than the
    Hoyer measure, here, the main difference between the two being a
    square root operation). I'm running now a parameter sweep over
    ~n_grc_dend~ and ~active_mf_fraction~ with a relatively small
    number of simulated patterns (100) to understand if this is a
    fluke or not, and more generally to compare the behaviour of the
    two sparseness measures across a wider range of conditions.
    
    <2013-12-05 Thu> The results from the parameter sweep look
    encouraging in terms of behaviour of the 'activity' sparseness. It
    looks like a (random) network with 4 dendrites sparsifies all
    the time, one with 6 dendrites keeps the sparseness roughly the
    same between input and output, and networks with 8 or 10 dendrites
    always amplify.

    <2013-12-11 Wed> From the point of view of information
    transmission, it looks like *the tissue model behaves very
    differently than the random bipartite graph*, especially at high
    p(MF).
    
* Other issues with the paper
** Work out a better graph-theoretical characterisation of the differences between the tissue model and the random bipartite graph.

*** Testing for 'randomness' in the mf->grc connectivity
If it were possible to measure the correlation range of the activity
of grcs following independent signals from the mfs, (see work by
Mapelli?), then given the measurements of the length of the grc
dendrites we should be able to test if the mf->grc connections are
'randomly' (ie after some opportunely constrained maxent distribution)
by predicting the correlation range and seeing if it matches with the
experiments. An easier proxy for correlation could be some sort of
LFP, given that we know the density of the grcs themselves.
